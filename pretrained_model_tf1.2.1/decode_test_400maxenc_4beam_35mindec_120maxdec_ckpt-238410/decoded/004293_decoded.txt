wladimir klitschko has confirmed that tyson fury will be his next opponent and the unified heavyweight champion .
the ibf , wba and wbo king ended his seven-year american hiatus by clearly out-pointing bryant jennings at madison square garden on saturday night .
it was not the dazzling new york display he had promised on his stateside return .
the fight against jennings was klitschko 's first in the united states since 2008 .
