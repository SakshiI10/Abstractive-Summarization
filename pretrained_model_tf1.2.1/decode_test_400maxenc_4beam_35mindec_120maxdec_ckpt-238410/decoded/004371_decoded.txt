mauresmo , who is expecting a baby in august , will be replaced by swede jonas bjorkman in the lead-up to the us open and quite possibly after that , depending on how she assesses her priorities .
the 27-year-old scot , who is in munich for this week 's bmw open and joined in the 100-year celebrations at the iphitos tennis club on monday night , parted company with ivan lendl last year because the czech was no longer able to spend half the year travelling .
murray originally considered bjorkman as a replacement for lendl .
