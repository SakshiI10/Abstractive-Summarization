former heavyweight boxing champion david haye , 34 , was stopped by officials on his arrival at dubai international airport .
the boxer , who has not fought since he defeated dereck chisora in july 2012 , also handed over his passport to authorities , and has been unable to leave the united arab emirates .
the cheque , worth 1.8 million emirati dirham , was intended as a final payment on a newly-built property , as part of a deal with developers emaar .
haye has said the ` bounced ' cheque was down to an administrative error .
