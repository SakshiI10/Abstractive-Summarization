the duchess of cambridge 's younger sister was seen going for an early evening run in a london park , stopping to chat to a fellow jogger .
the royal sister topped off the chicness of her ensemble with a peek at a pink sports bra underneath her blue top .
the playful kicks would also look great paired with skinny black jeans and a cozy oversized sweater for an off duty .
