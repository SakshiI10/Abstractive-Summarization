the flashgap app is free for ios and android and was created by julian kabab .
before a night out , one user creates an event and becomes that event 's host .
during the night , photos and videos can be taken using the app and each shot lasts for just three seconds before it disappears .
all attendees are notified that the album is ready to be viewed .
