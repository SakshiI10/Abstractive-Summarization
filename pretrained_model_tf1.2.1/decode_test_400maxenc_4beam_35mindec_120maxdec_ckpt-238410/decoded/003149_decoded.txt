former home of james bond author ian fleming , the luxury penthouse by the thames is on the market for # 6.75 million .
land registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect .
but it is possible the sale took place shortly before , meaning the increased charges would have been avoided .
now campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of chelsea .
