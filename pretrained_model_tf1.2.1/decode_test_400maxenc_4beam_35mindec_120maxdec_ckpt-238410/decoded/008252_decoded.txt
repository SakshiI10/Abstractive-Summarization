amnesty international says siti zainab 's family was not notified before her execution this morning .
the domestic worker was sentenced to death in 1999 after confessing to stabbing her employer who allegedly mistreated her to death .
she was on death row for over 15 years while saudi authorities waited for the victim 's youngest child to reach adulthood - to decide whether or not the family wanted to pardon zainab or demand her execution .
