claudetteia love , a senior and one of the top students at carroll high in monroe , said she was planning on going to the prom without a date and with a group of friends , but now she and her friends are staying away .
though a petition was started and signed by members of the senior class to allow love to wear a tuxedo , it was not acted on by school faculty .
principal patrick taylor told love that the decision was dress-code related and that she should n't take it personally .
