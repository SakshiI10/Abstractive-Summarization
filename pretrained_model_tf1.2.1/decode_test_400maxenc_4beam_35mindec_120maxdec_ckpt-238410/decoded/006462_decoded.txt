peter morris was devastated when his sister , claire , died in car crash .
only a year before , he had walked her down the aisle to give her away to her husband , malcolm webster , from surrey , then aged 33 , who seemed equally bereft at the loss of his wife .
webster had in fact been murdered by webster so he could cash in on her life insurance .
