tamoxifen is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause .
most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow , and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells .
this means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether .
