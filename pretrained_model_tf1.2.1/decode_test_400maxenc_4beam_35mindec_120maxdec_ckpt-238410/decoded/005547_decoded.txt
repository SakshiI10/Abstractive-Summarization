panasonic has developed a lighter , smaller and more powerful alternative that can blow out seven times more air than it sucks in .
the sokaze-ki q uses fluid dynamics to take air in at the rear of the 10-inch -lrb- 25cm -rrb- device , a ` high-pressure jet airflow ' creates straight , direct blasts of air .
alternatively , the q has a ' 1/f fluctuation ' function that reduces the force of the air flow .
