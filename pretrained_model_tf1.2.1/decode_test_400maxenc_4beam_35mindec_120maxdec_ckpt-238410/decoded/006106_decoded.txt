ed miliband was last night accused of snubbing britain 's army of self-employed workers .
the magazine of the respected association of independent professionals and the self-employed -lrb- ipse -rrb- carries tributes from nearly every major party leader to people who work for themselves .
but while david cameron , nick clegg , nigel farage and nicola sturgeon all feature , there is no message from mr miliband .
