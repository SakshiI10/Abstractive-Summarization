andrew chan , 21 , and myuran sukumaran , 24 , came to have in common was the belief that smuggling drugs would provide them with a short cut to the life of ease and glamour and - their biggest mistake - that they could get away with it .
thirteen years since their fateful first meeting , after all their legal appeals and pleas for clemency have been rejected .
dubbed the masterminds behind the $ 4 million drug plot from the very beginning , the death penalty has never left the table for chan and sukumaran since they were first convicted in 2005 following a tip off from australian federal police to indonesian officials .
