robin , now 73 , was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by chance in 1999 .
he was as much a heart throb as aidan turner , star of the hugely successful bbc remake of the cornish epic .
in fact , even now at the age of 73 robin has retained the physique that helped make him famous - as he showed in a cameo in the bbc remake .
yet even though he has been slim all his life - 12st , which is perfect for his 6ft 1 1/2 in frame - robin has type 2 diabetes .
