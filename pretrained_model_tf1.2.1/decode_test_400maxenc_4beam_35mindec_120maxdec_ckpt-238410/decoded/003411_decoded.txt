barcelona president josep maria bartomeu has reiterated the club 's stance that messi will always have a place at the nou camp .
messi , who has been with the catalan giants since the age of 13 , was linked with a move away from the nou camp earlier this year .
messi , who scored his 400th goal for barca in saturday 's 2-0 triumph over valencia , is set to play alongside luis suarez and neymar .
