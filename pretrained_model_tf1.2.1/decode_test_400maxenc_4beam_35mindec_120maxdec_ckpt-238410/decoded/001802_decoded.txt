mark o'meara rolled back the years with one of the standout rounds of the day .
the 1998 champion was one over after the first round but five birdies in his second , including three in four holes on the front nine , saw him card a 68 and ensure he will still be in the running .
o'meara is the third oldest man in the field in 2015 .
