belinda , 56 , from essex , admits she wishes she 'd never had a facelift .
but the ` horrendous ' scars produced by the bungling surgeon have left her bereft of confidence and feeling worse than ever before .
in the uk , the average facelift costs # 7,900 , so belinda was thrilled when she found a turkish surgeon offering cut-price operations that cost a fraction of the uk equivalent .
