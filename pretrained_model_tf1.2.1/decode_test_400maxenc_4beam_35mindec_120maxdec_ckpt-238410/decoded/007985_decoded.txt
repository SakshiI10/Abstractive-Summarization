myanmar 's newly-built capital city , naypyidaw , is shrouded in secrecy .
it first became the capital of myanmar a decade ago .
since then , although developed to be the size of 120 manhattans and to have space for up to one million residents , it remains a relative ghost town .
official records state the population is just over 924,000 .
