the 1904 victorian build in bay will be sold at a live auction by tim hawko of zephyr real estate .
the 1904 property was teeming with black widows , rats , feces and 300 bottles of urine when it was discovered on april 4 .
but apparently , it 's still a hot ticket - just a week after removing the rodents , trash , and corpse , realtors have priced this san francisco property at a cool $ 2.5 million .
still worth it ! property developers are expected to pay millions for this house .
