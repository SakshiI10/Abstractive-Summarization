james houlder and girlfriend vicki hood had saved up for months for the sunshine break at the sonesta beach resort in sharm el sheikh .
but within just hours of arriving at the first choice resort , which is described as five-star on its website , the couple say they became violently ill with sickness and diarrhoea .
the couple , who live just outside norwich , had booked the break last summer and envisaged 10 days sunning themselves on the beach and scuba diving in the red sea .
