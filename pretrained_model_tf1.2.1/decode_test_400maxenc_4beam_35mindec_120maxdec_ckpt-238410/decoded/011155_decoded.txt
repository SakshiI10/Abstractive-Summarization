james was at practice with his cleveland cavalier teammates on saturday .
the one-handed shot , which traveled almost the entire length of the 94-foot court , dropped through the basket with an audible swish .
instead of tossing the ball overhand , howard used a motion that was one part underhand and one part sidearm to make his full-court shot find paydirt .
