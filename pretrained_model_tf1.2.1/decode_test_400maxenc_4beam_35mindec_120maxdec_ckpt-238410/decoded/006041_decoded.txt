elephants will be taken to the ringling brothers elephant conservation center in an undisclosed , 200-acre area of polk county .
some of the asian elephants will live out their post-performance lives in the center , while other will be used for breeding .
this will hopefully increase genetic diversity in the species and increase its population .
