the # 9 homemade rowing boat in which the two anglers ventured out on to the open sea .
amazingly , the 6ft vessel held together long enough for the men to set up their rods and haul in some fish .
but they were scuppered when an oar snapped 200 yards off jaywick , essex , and they had to call 999 .
