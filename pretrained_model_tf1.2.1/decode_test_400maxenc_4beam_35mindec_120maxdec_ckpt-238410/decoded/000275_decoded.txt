lz granderson : i remember traveling one day in the local train in mumbai with my mother , my younger sister and brother .
the stories can be stomach churning : men masturbating on buses and at bus stops , boys stalking young girls .
it was only recently that i realized my phobia of trains likely originated with that bad experience i had as a child .
