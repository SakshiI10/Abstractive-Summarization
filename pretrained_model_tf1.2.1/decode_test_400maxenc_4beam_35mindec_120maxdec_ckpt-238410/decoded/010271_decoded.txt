fire boat massey shaw has been restored to its former glory seven decades after helping to save 600 troops from the dunkirk beaches .
the boat went out of service in 1971 , and four decades was used as a walkway in a london dock .
it took six years to undo the damage wrought on the massey shaw and restore it to how it was in the 1930s .
