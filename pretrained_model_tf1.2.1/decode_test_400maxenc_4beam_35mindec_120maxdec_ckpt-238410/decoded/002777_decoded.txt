stuart broad admits he was a lovely guy and i feel sorry he 's lost his job but when you get new people in , changes always happen .
he 's certainly a very good man , but it 's hard to know who would be a good candidate until we know more about what the job role is .
but strauss , michael vaughan and alec stewart are all former england captains .
