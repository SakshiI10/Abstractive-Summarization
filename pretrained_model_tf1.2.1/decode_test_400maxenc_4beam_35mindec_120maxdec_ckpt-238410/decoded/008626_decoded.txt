a huge marine corps helicopter made an emergency landing on a southern california beach on wednesday , bringing no damages or injuries but leaving an unforgettable spectacle for surrounding swimmers and sunbathers .
the ch-53e copter is twice the size of the humpback whales that sometimes wash up on surrounding shores .
it crouched on the sand below a bluff and only a few yards from the surf line .
