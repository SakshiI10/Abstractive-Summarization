hamdi ulukaya was once a turkish immigrant with dreams of making it big in the u.s. food industry .
his ex , dr. ayse giray , has settled a lawsuit filed by his ex-wife , who laid claim to half the $ 2 billion greek yogurt empire .
the settlement came just before manhattan supreme court justice saliann scarpulla was due to rule on whether giray could retroactively be named a shareholder in chobani 's predecessor company .
