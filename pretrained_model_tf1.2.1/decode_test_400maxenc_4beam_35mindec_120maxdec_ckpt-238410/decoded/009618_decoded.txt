the pair were convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the ` raucous screams ' during steamy sex sessions at their apartment in the northern town of san martino .
their long-suffering neighbours , who first took them to court in 2009 , described the wails of passion as ` deafening ' and said it kept them and their two children awake .
the couple , who are in their 30s , have been ordered to pay # 7,000 in damages to their neighbours who now live elsewhere , and # 2,000 in legal fees .
