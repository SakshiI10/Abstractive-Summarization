campaigners are calling for the government to implement an almost 90-year-old law .
after next month 's election , ministers could be asked to make sure easter day always falls between april 9 and 15 , so businesses can plan holiday rotas in advance and allow the travel industry to better prepare for the summer season .
in 1928 , the easter act was passed in parliament to make sure that the holiday weekend would be a fixed date in april .
