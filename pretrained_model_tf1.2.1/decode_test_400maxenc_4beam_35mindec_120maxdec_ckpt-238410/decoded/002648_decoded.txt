blackburn 's fa cup journey about to end , simon eastwood appeared for a corner and found the ball at his feet as it dropped from a jumble of players 12 yards out .
eastwood , oddly , had time and , even more strangely given the melee in the area .
as it happened , his right-foot shot on the turn was struck well enough but it was straight at liverpool goalkeeper simon mignolet , who managed to parry the ball and then grab it as it threatened to spin over the line .
