real estate heir robert durst was indicted wednesday on two weapons charges .
a grand jury charged durst with possession of a firearm by a felon , and possession of both a firearm and an illegal drug : 5 ounces of marijuana .
durst 's attorneys maintain that the arrest on weapons charges was illegal , partly because fbi agents searched durst 's hotel room without a search warrant and before his arrest .
