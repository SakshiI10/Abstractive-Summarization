research has revealed that the frequency with which britons are having sex has been in decline since the emergence of the internet .
it comes after professor david spiegelhalter , a statistician at cambridge university , revealed in a new book how a typical heterosexual couple was now having sex three times a month .
this was compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990 .
