the seven-car maglev hit a top speed of 375mph -lrb- 603 km/h -rrb- and travelled for almost 11 seconds at speeds above 373mph -lrb- 600km/h -rrb- during a test run near mount fuji .
the run beat last week 's speeds of 366mph -lrb- 590kph -rrb- , which in turn beat the train 's previous 12-year record of 361mph -lrb- 581km/h -rrb- .
the technology promises a ride that 's smoother , quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail .
but vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future .
