paul tudor jones ii , the billionaire founder of tudor investment corporation , bought the casa apava estate in palm beach last week .
the mediterranean-style seven-bedroom , 18-bathroom property was built in 1918 and has 420 feet of oceanfront access , as well as a tennis court , movie theater , swimming pool and gym .
the hefty purchase came days after jones , 60 , warned that increasing inequality could spark a revolution as he gave a sold-out ted talk in march .
