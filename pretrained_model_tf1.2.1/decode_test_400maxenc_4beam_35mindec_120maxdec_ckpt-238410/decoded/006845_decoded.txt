davion navar henry only , 16 , became the face of adoption and an example of all the struggles faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up in a suit and told worshipers at florida 's st mark missionary baptist church .
he then said ; ` my name is davion and i 've been in foster care since i was born .
i know god has n't given up on me , so i 'm not giving up either .
the best i could be .
' most of all , davion said he just wanted a family that would ` love him forever '
