the disused rhondda tunnel , which runs 1,000 feet beneath the welsh hills , was closed as part of the beeching cutbacks , a project which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network in britain .
but engineers are due to visit the 3,148 m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route .
