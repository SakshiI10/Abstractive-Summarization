the wondrous great wall of china was created in 500 bc to protect the country 's northern border against foreign invasion .
the wall attracts over 10 million visitors annually so you could be battling your way through the crowds and not just the steep inclines .
while it is still fun to say that flying on a private jet , and on a commercial flight are polar opposite travelling experiences .
