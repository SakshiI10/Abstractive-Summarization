a lifetime of following spurs can have that effect on you , especially in recent years .
last saturday 's inept capitulation to aston villa was the most recent occasion : a soft goal down after 45 minutes and an expensively assembled team which looked as if it had been recruited from the local jobcentre half an hour before the kick-off .
they are especially vigilant when it comes to anyone blocking the gangways or stairwells .
