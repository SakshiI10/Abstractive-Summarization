president obama gave the spy agency a pass on providing proof that intended targets of drone strikes posed an imminent threat to the us .
according to the wall street journal , which first reported the story monday citing current and former government officials .
argues the article , the january drone strike that killed two hostages , one of them an american , could have been postponed or even prevented entirely .
without obama 's waiver , cia operatives would have been forced to gather additional information and surveillance data on the al qaeda-linked militants targeted in the january 15 strike .
