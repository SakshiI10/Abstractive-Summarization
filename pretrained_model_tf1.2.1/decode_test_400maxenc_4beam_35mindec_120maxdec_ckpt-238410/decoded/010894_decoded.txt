randy and jodi speidel , from bellefontaine , ohio , took their own lives this week , more than two months after their desperate pleas for help went ignored .
mrs speidel wrote that they had been living without gas all winter , had no running water and were close to having their electricity and internet service shut off .
the couple 's landlord , doug elleman , arrived at their rental at 225 west high avenue to discover a pink handwritten note warning passersby of carbon monoxide inside .
