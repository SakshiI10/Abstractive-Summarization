paula mckay told her daughter natasha had brain damage and would be left disabled after errors were made by medics at the hospital where they were both born , two years apart .
she was delivered 10 weeks prematurely by c-section , but staff failed to ventilate her properly , which caused severe brain damage .
maternity staff at the hospital failed to monitor ms mckay , and failed to recognise natasha was in distress in the womb .
