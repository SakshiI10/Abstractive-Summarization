baby arley was born on the i-65 in louisville , kentucky , on tuesday .
it was bumper-to-bumper all up the i-65 in louisville for president obama 's visit to the city to tour a technology plant and give a speech about the economy , worsened because obama had been caught up in washington d.c. jessica brown was on her way to hospital with her husband , zakk satterley , when the couple realized , in standstill traffic , they were n't going to make it .
fortunately there was a nurse also stuck in her car nearby , who was able to run over and help deliver the little boy , arley , safely .
