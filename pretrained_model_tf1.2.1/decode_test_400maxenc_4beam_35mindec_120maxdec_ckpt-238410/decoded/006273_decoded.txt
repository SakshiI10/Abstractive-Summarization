hilary wilson , from whitchurch , shropshire , was technically dead for 11 minutes .
it was only when she saw a picture of her new baby wearing her children 's hand-me-downs .
when she woke up , she had no idea that she had been pregnant , or that she had given birth to felix just days earlier .
the mother-of-three has defied the odds and made a remarkable recovery .
