ap mccoy has fired a borrowed phrase from sir steve redgrave .
the 40-year-old rider , who has two final rides at sandown on saturday , said : ` to be fair to steve redgrave , you have to put your body through physical torture to try and win a fifth gold medal in boat .
' i can ride for pleasure and hopefully it will be less dangerous than it was when i was competing , from a mental perspective ' after winning a fourth olympic gold medal , redgrave famously said : ` anyone who sees me in a boat has my permission to shoot me '
