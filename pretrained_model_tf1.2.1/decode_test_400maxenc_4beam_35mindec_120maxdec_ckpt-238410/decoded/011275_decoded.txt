stunning ashbrittle yew , in churchyard of st john the baptist , in somerset , has a girth of 38ft and an enormous vast canopy .
its central trunk is hollow with six smaller ones branching off - possible due to disease - and locals fear it is on its way out due to wilting branches and falling leaves .
the 4,000-year-old tree is ` looking extremely sick , ' according to a warden at the church in ashbrittle , somerset .
