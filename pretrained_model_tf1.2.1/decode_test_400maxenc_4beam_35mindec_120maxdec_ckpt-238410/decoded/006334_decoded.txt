the 9th us circuit court of appeals confirmed that the washington supreme court did not act unreasonably when it rejected clark elmore 's claim his constitutional rights were violated at trial .
elmore , who was convicted of killing kristy ohnstad in bellingham after he said she threatened to reveal he had molested her as a child , received the federal court 's ruling on wednesday .
the ruling does not mean elmore will be executed as governor jay inslee has declared a moratorium on the death penalty .
