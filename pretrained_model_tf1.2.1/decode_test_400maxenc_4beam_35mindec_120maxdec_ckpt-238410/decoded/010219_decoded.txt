christopher swain , a clean-water activist , embarked on a 1.8-mile swim in the toxic gowanus canal .
he swam about an hour into the canal in a stunt to urge environmental clean up that ultimately succumbed to the water 's pollution .
the swimmer , who quit two-thirds of a mile into the swim , gargled hydrogen peroxide periodically to prevent contaminated water from getting down his throat .
