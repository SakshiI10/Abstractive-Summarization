the ncaa championship game , which ended 4-3 and was played at the td garden in boston , will always be remembered for the game-tying goal allowed by bu 's matt o'connor , not the winner .
o'connor lost track of a puck in his glove after it was dumped towards his net and managed to kick it in the net .
