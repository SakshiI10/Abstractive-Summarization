the tiny montana outpost was established in the 1860s by miners looking for gold and silver , but it was devastated by fire around 1912 and deserted a few years later .
while the town has since been restored , it remains empty , and local folklore says the area is haunted by former residents .
now the u.s. bureau of land management is offering free food , housing a job to people willing to live in garnet and work as a tour operator .
