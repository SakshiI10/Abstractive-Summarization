alexander bradley appeared in bristol county superior court on wednesday .
he would be able to testify that hernandez had access to the type of pistol he is accused of using to murder semipro football player odin lloyd , but not about a separate 2013 incident in which bradley contends hernandez shot him in the face .
lloyd was found shot dead in june 2013 in an industrial park near hernandez 's home in north attleborough , massachusetts .
