former wisconsin sheriff 's deputy andrew steele , pictured in court earlier this month , has been found not legally responsible in the killing of his wife and sister-in-law .
defense attorneys argued that the disease damaged steele 's brain , making him not criminally responsible for the deaths .
during steele 's trial earlier this month forensic psychiatrist dr. doug tucker had testified that a rambling note steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife .
