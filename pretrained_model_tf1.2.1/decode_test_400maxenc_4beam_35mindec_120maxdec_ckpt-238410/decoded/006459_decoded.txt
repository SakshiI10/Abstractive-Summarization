labour has been accused of ` utter hypocrisy ' after it was revealed working for one of their election chiefs are paid just # 4 per day for 12-hour shifts .
now labour is trying to get around the problem by saying the interns will be paid nothing at all , making them volunteers rather than workers .
labour 's 2015 manifesto has sought to champion working-class britons by increasing the minimum wage to # 8 per hour .
