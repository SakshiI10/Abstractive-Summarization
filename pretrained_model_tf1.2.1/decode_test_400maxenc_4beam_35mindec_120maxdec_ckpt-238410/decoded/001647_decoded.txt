jonathan trott and alastair cook scored for the first time since a brief experiment in bangladesh five years ago in what was a low-key return to work after the embarrassment of england 's first round world cup exit .
if trott 's return with 72 was the most pleasing aspect of a dominant day for england then an unbeaten 95 for captain alastair cook .
