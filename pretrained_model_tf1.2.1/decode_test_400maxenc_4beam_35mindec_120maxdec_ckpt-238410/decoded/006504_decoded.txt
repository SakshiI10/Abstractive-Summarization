douglas murphy was cleaning up after a children 's picnic when he bumped his leg against a bin bag .
a cut so small it was hardly visible , causing the rare condition necrotizing faciitis - a flesh-eating bug .
so extreme was mr murphy 's infection , surgeons were preparing to amputate his right leg .
but as they were printing out the paperwork to authorise the procedure .
