holly barber , from manchester , woke up feeling unwell and with chest and neck pains - but chalked it down to heavy drinking a few days before .
but when the 25-year-old started coughing up blood she knew it was something serious .
doctors found 13 pulmonary embolisms , blood clots blocking the main artery of her lungs , killing the tissue and stopping her from breathing properly .
