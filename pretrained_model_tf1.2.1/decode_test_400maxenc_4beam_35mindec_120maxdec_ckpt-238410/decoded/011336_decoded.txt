just one of the inca rope bridges remains : the wheel was yet to be invented , iron was foreign and steel was unheard of .
so when the incas needed to travel across the andes , they did so on handwoven rope bridges .
as they expanded their empire , the incas built an entire network of bridges to move armies , people and goods quickly over the mountains .
