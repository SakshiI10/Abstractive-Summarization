the perfect dog has the body size of a border collie , the snout of a labrador and the eyes of a beagle .
the research found more than a third of owners wanted their dog to have a short , low-maintenance coat , while a similar proportion favoured soft , floppy ears .
almost half said their ideal dog would be ` standard-sized ' like a collie .
