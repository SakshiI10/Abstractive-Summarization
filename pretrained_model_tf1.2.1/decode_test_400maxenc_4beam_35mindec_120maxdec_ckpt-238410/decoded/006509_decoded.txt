swan , which sold its first iron in 1933 , has just released a top-of-the-range steam generator iron , for # 279.99 .
if you loathe ironing enough to splash out almost # 300 , then swan 's model could be the one for you .
it 's usually my least favouite chore , but when testing this one , i got to work in front of poldark and was done within 20 minutes .
