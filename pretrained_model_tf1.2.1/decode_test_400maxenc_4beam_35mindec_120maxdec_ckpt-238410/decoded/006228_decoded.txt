xiao zhengti , five , was born with congenital liver disease meaning he needed his first transplant at just nine months old .
the boy 's body rejected the organ , leading to years of trips to hospital , leading to a full recovery .
the touching story began in 2009 shortly after xiao was born to parents from southern china 's hunan province with jaundice , which is common in babies .
