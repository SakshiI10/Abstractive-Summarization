channel 4 's indian summers star headed to phuket in thailand .
at the end of filming channel 4 's indian summers last year , i headed to koh phangan , an island off ko samui , and did a week-long meditation and yoga course .
so i jumped at the chance of heading out to thailand again before the start of filming series two .
