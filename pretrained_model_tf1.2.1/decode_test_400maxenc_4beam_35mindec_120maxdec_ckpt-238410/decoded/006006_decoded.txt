james paul harris , 30 , originally was charged with first-degree murder in the 2011 garroting death of james gerety , but pleaded no contest in december to involuntary manslaughter .
the victim 's brother , tom gerety , called the justice system ' a joke ' after learning how long harris would serve .
on monday , a judge sentenced harris to four years and two months .
but osage county attorney brandon jones said pursuing the more serious charge posed challenges because of problems with the case .
