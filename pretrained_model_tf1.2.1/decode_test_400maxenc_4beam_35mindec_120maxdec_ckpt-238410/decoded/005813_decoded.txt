alan spencer , 67 , was tucking into his dinner when the pickled onion blocked his windpipe .
he frantically tried to clear his throat , and after three minutes made his way to the door in a bid to get help from a passer-by .
but he collapsed in his hallway and jumped on to the centre of alan 's back , dislodging the onion and saving her owner 's life .
