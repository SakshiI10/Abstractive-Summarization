villagers in the small country hamlet of cledford , near middlewich in cheshire , had vehemently opposed the plans saying that travellers could ` intimidate ' nearby pensioners .
but yesterday , cheshire east council gave the proposal the go ahead at a planning meeting , which will create a ` transit site ' with room for nine gipsy families .
the mansion 's grade-ii listed adjoining barn will be converted into ` washing and toilet ' facilities .
