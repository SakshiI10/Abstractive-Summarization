the seattle times reports that nearly half of the money on the gofundme.com page set up in february for 70-year-old barronelle stutzman came in the last several days .
supporters compare stutzman 's benefit page to an indiana pizza shop that raised more than $ 800,000 after the florist was fined for refusing to provide a gay couple with flowers for their 2013 wedding .
stutzman , owner of arlene 's flowers and gifts in richland , washington , received the fine in benton county superior court in march .
