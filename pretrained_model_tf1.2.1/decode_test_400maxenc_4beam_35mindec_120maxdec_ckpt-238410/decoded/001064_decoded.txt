ayatollah khomeini says he was `` drinking poison '' when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight-year-old war with iraq .
the war had helped define khomeini 's regime , the islamic republic , which he had founded a year before saddam hussein invaded iran .
by the time he ended the war , the economy was in shambles .
