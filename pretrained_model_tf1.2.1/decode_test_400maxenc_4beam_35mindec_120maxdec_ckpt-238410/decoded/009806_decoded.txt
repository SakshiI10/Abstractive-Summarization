neuroscientists have identified the area of the brain that is the key to picking up on when someone is being sarcastic .
they found that people with damage to the right sagittal stratum - a bundle of white matter that lies between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures in the brain - are unable to detect sarcasm .
stroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of their brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic .
