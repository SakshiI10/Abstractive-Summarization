kelsey higley , who studies art media at the university of oklahoma in norman , created a fascinating self-portrait of her body , showing what it would look like if it were digitally trimmed or augmented into various shapes .
the 22-year-old 's work , which is part of a project and has been published on video-sharing site vimeo , shows just how different her frame might look if she had , for example , an hour-glass figure , or larger boobs .
the project , entitled ` manipulation ' , plays in a non-stop loop for over a minute and sees her proportions morphing into different shapes , highlighting the constantly changing beauty ideals that women face .
