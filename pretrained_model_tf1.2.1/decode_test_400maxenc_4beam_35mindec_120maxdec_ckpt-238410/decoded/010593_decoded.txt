san antonio police officers issued a fine to local chef and activist joan cheever for feeding the homeless at maverick park .
cheever founded the chow train non-profit organization in 2005 , preparing hot meals in her licensed mobile kitchen and serving them at city parks out of her personal pickup , which she has been using as a delivery truck because it is more maneuverable .
on april 7 , san antonio police officers allowed cheever and her volunteers to continue distributing the meals .
