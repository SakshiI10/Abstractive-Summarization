one of the stunning watercolours , showing the moment dorothy , toto , the tinman , the lion and the scarecrow meet the wizard of oz for the first time , went for # 25,000 .
the other , imagining the emerald city , capital of the land of oz and home to the wizard , sold for # 10,000 .
it is thought that after filming was over the studio - metro-goldwyn-mayer - sold off the paintings .
