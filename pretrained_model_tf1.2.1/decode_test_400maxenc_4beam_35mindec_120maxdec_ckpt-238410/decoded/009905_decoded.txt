caitlin kellie-jones suffered from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy , a type of brain damage that occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood .
to control the condition caitlin was placed in a special cooling wrap within 40 minutes of her birth .
it allows the brain to cool down and minimises the damage from the lack of oxygen .
thankfully , caitlin , now ten months old , seems to be developing normally .
