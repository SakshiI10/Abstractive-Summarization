comcast is abandoning its bid to buy time warner cable for $ 45.2 billion and create a mega-size tv and internet provider , it was reported today .
the move comes after federal communications commission decided that merger was n't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like disney and 21st century fox .
bloomberg , followed by the new york times , reported thursday afternoon that comcast is planning to ` walk away ' from the deal .
