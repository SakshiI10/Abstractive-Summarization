cassandra fortin , 17 , was released from hospital on monday after she was removed from her home on monday .
the teenager said she was ` happy ' to be heading back to her hartford home after spending five months undergoing chemotherapy to save her life .
cassandra , whose cancer is now in remission , made national headlines last year after she and her mother initially refused the treatment .
but in january , a court ruled that cassandra could not make the decision because she was not legally mature enough and the state 's department of children and families gained temporary custody .
