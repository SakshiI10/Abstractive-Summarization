richard iii 's skeleton found under a car park in leicester was found to be an exaggeration of a spine deformity known as scoliosis .
the genetic analysis showed that richard iii almost certainly had blue eyes and likely had blonde hair - although it may have darkened with age .
despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs , there is no evidence he walked with a limp .
