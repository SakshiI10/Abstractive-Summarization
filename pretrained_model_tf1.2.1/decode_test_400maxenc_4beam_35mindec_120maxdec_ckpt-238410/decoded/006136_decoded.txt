nathan sellers went on the show with his ex , lia palmquist , and accused her of sleeping with every member of the wu-tang clan during one night as she partied with them at a hotel after a show .
that would mean palmquist had sex with the rza , the gza , ghostface killah , u-god deck , raekwon and method man .
the tenth member of the wu , ol' dirty bastard , is dead so he was n't involved .
