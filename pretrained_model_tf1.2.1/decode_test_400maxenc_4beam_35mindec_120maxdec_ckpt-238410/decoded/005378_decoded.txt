hannah and alex purchased a 1986 hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love .
the result was a solar-powered two-bedroom , wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in nelson , new zealand .
after a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time , the project took shape .
