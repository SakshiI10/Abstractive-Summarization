jenna marotta , 27 , of new york , says her habit of picking at the pores on her face was so all-consuming that it became ` self-sabotaging ' at first , jenna was just looking for a way to break out of her binge-eating routine .
as a child she developed bad eating habits - she would skip breakfast and lunch , then stuff her face with whatever she wanted for hours when she got home .
' i knew i was bingeing while i was bingeing , ' she writes .
