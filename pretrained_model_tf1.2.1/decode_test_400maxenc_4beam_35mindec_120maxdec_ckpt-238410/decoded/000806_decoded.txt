a controversial beijing-backed election proposal tabled wednesday that pro-democracy legislators have already sworn to veto , describing it as `` ridiculous '' in a speech before the city 's legislature , chief secretary carrie lam said that if approved , the proposal would give hong kongers the right to vote for their next leader in 2017 .
the catch , of course , is candidates would have to be approved by a mostly pro-china committee .
hong kong has become increasingly polarized over the last few years .
