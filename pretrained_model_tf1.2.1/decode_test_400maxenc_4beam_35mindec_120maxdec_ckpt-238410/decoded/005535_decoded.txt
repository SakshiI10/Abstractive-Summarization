vietnamese labourer pham lanh , 28 , had a metal plate inserted over his skull .
the botched operation caused his head to become swollen with deadly infection .
mr lanh hoped the resulting headaches would eventually subside .
it was only when he asked family to look at the wound that they noticed a dozen maggots crawling under the skin .
