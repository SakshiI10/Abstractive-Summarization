brent council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live-in carer to look after second world war veteran robert clark at his home in burnt oak , north london .
this is despite the fact he had already used # 50,000 of his life savings paying for his care .
the pensioner 's plight prompted armed forces charity help for heroes to launch a fund-raising campaign to allow mr clark to stay in his own home .
