the three men - thomas jordan driver , 25 , and charles thomas newcomb , 42 , were arrested thursday and each faces one state count of conspiracy to commit murder .
the case comes as the latest black eye for the troubled state prison system .
newcomb was fired in 2013 for failing to meet training requirements .
