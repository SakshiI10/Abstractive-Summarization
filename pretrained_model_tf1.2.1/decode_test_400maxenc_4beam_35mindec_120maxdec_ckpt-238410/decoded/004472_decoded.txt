the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array , or nustar , has captured a new high-energy x-ray view -lrb- magenta -rrb- of the bustling center of our milky way galaxy .
the smaller circle shows the center of our galaxy where the nustar image was taken .
the emission could also be due to millisecond pulsars - rapidly rotating neutron stars - or dense magnetic fields .
