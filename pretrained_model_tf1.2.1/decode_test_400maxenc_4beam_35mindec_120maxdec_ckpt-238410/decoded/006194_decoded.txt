a pair of armed with handguns have robbed three banks in the pittsburgh area so far this year , most recently on april 10 .
the unknown men , who are seen on surveillance footage pointing their guns at bank employees ' heads , have threatened to kidnapping those at their targets and shoot police .
however , the way that the two men handle their weapons has led the fbi to suspect that the thieves are actually former police officers themselves .
