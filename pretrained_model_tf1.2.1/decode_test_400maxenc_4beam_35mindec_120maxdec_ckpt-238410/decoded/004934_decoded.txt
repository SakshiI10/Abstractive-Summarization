self-styled ` anarchist libertarian ' squatters have set up camp in one of london 's most historic monuments .
it is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight , as a garbled message posted on facebook by the group simply calls for ` christmas lights ... any and all radical/revolutionary messages ' the protesters mounted the arch which joins trafalgar square with the mall , and called for others to join them .
