tech giant is under pressure by top cops to turn off the app 's police-tracking function .
the app , which operates like a free gps navigation tool , allows users to tag the locations of parked police vehicles , accidents , traffic cameras , potholes and more , so that other drivers using waze are warned as they approach the same location .
waze , which google acquired waze in 2013 for a reported $ 1.1 billion has 50million users in 200 countries , a number which is growing .
it has since been deleted .
