prosecutors say james holmes , 27 , was once a sought-after neuroscientist-in-training , but evidence shows that months before the shooting he was preparing for violence .
the prosecution is trying to prove that holmes was not mentally ill and knew exactly what he was doing the night of july 2012 .
if the 12 final jurors , chosen from a pool of 9,000 , decide that holmes was mentally ill at the time of the shooting , he will be committed indefinitely to a state psychiatric hospital .
