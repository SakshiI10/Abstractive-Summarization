flattering note : even though this letter left for natasha hope-simpson on her windshield is filled with venom and anger , she viewed it as flattering because someone could not tell she was missing her leg .
all types of disabilities : natasha hope-simpson , pictured with a friend , has a disability but because her prosthetic leg was covered , someone thought she was lying about being handicapped .
