Summary:
five goals from 31 appearances this season may well make him sunderland’s top scorer , but that masks what have been subdued and often sluggish performances , even if he remains their likeliest match-winner .
for although , during three seasons on wearside , johnson’s three goals in a trio of victories at north east rivals newcastle have undoubtedly been the highlight , affording him terrace adulation , sunderland had expected far more when they laid down an eight-figure sum and wages of £50,000 per week .
