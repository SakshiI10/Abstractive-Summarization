Summary:
true , they could have benefited more from refereeing decisions – bafetimbi gomis was offside in the build up to his brilliant first goal and david meyler’s second-half red card could have gone either way – but that should not exonerate a side that is supposed to be fighting for it life and yet looked so meek for half of this match .
they managed no shots on goal in the time it took swansea to go 2-0 ahead through ki sung-yueng and gomis’s bicycle kick .
