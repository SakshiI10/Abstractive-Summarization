Summary:
given hook 's quality at fly-half , centre and full-back , it is baffling to the layman that wales head coach warren gatland can not find room for him in his matchday 23 or wider squads .
gareth anscombe is being widely touted as wales ' likely world cup utility back , suggesting that even if hook makes a 45-man training squad to be announced in early june , gatland 's final 31-man cut could prove beyond him .
