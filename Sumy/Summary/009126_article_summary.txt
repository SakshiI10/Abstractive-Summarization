Summary:
manchester united ( 4-3-3 ) david de gea – one of the quietest afternoons he has had all season ; perhaps that explained his aberration for aston villa’s goal – 6 .
aston villa ( 4-4-2 ) brad guzan – earned his keep with saves from rojo , blind , rooney and fellaini ; couldn’t do anything about herrera’s goal – 7 .
