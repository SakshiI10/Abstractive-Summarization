Summary:
( cnn ) i do n't always talk about news events with my daughters , but there was something about the story of espn reporter britt mchenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up .
this morning , i told her mchenry was suspended for a week by espn , and that led to another conversation .
