Summary:
clinton will face a harder balancing act : how to stand by the policies that she helped craft in obama 's first term and still separate herself from an administration her opponents will blast as weak , vacillating and fairly or not , responsible for a world that is seen to be much worse , especially in the middle east and with russia , than when president obama took office .
indeed , given the president 's vulnerabilities on foreign policy , she ca n't afford to be seen as obama 's third term .
