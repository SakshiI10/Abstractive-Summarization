Summary:
taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in league one – it’s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years ( gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010 ) this season looks like being different , though , after crewe’s draw with leyton orient left both clubs plus crawley on 47 points with four games still to play .
that means sleepless nights for crawley boss dean saunders who’ll have bad memories of going down from the championship with wolves despite finishing on 51 points .
