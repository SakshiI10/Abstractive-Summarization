Summary:
liverpool defender martin skrtel ( right ) will have his hands full trying to stop benteke on sunday afternoon .
ron vlaar and nathan baker make an imposing back line but they would rather be up against a benteke than a raheem sterling , who will float around and make himself difficult to mark so he can use his lightning pace to get in behind them .
