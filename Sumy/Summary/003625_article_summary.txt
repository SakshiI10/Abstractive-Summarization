Summary:
while exact details arenâ€™t known at the moment , another company - tethers unlimited - has demonstrated how structures could be built in space with their spiderfab proposal , a system of robo-spiders that would build parts of spacecraft in orbit , although mr kemp told mailonline that the uss method would be ' different ' .
however , they actually still experience about 90 per cent of earth 's gravity , but the constant falling makes them seem weightless .
