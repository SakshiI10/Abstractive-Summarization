the australian men are expected to be led from their isolated cells in batu prison through the wildly dense tropical forest up a 3km steep winding track to a place called nirbaya - or more appropriately known as death valley .
this comes as coffins with both men 's names and wednesday 's date were inscribed on wooden crosses by local funeral director suhendra putro .
