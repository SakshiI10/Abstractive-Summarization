Summary:
rows over goal-line technology were hardly something new when frank lampard’s infamous ‘ghost’ goal against germany in the 2010 world cup finally brought matters to a head .
my personal view is yes , sensibly , but it needs to be done in a manner that doesn’t detract from the fast-paced , quick action of football .
