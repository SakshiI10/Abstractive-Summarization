Summary:
eritreans want to escape repression or military service ; somalis flee al-shabaab and clan warfare ; syrians have given up hope of returning home .
algeria has also been a destination for syrian refugees , but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes -- often through turkey and the greek islands .
