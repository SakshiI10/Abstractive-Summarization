Summary:
despite national earnings that make us the world’s fifth richest country , living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness , particularly obesity .
it broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and left-wing thinkers – for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young , if contraception is universally available , and for low greenhouse gas emissions , but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood .
