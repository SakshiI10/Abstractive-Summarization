Summary:
rodgers does not intend to be as busy as last year when he made eight new signings – burnley’s danny ings and james milner of manchester city are prime targets , while aston villa striker christian benteke could be an option – but depay is a marker of their ambitions .
‘ if we are not in the champions league , players will still maybe want to come , ’ said rodgers , who could be without steven gerrard at hull tomorrow night after he picked up a “knock” .
