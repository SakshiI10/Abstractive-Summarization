Summary:
some examples : city have nine points fewer than at this stage last season ; their 4-2 defeat against manchester united saw them concede four for the first time since 2009 ; they have lost four of their past six premier league games and five in 2015 , which is one more than in the whole of 2014 .
four of those league games are away from anfield , but like city , it is not a run-in that would have one cursing their luck .
