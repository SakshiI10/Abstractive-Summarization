Summary:
even though kurt died in the most horrific way possible , there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him , because he 's 27 forever .
for me , the film provided a lot more factual information about my father -- not just tall tales that were misconstrued , misremembered , rehashed , retold 10 different ways .
