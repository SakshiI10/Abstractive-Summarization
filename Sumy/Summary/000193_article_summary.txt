Summary:
murayama clearly condemned `` mistaken national policy , '' `` self-righteous nationalism , '' `` colonial rule '' and `` aggression , '' but abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called `` masochistic '' view of japan 's wartime history .
journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in japan for some time , but under abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier .
