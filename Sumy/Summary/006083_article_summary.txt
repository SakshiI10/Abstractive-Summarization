Summary:
rosberg accused mercedes team-mate hamilton of deliberately compromising his race at last weekend’s chinese grand prix by slowing down but mika hakkinen said the british driver’s tactics , which saw him win a third consecutive grand prix ahead of the german , were entirely legitimate .
‘ nico has definitely got big pressure on him , ’ said hakkinen , ‘ he does n't know how it feels to be a world champion and does n't know what confidence a world championship generates inside you when you are racing driver .
