Summary:
earlier this month france passed a new law that bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low , in an attempt to combat anorexia .
because models are considered independent contractors in the us , standard employment laws , which allow workers mandatory breaks , compensation for injuries and protection from sexual harassment , do not apply .
