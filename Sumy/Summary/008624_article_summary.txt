Summary:
van gaal was furious last summer with the amount of travelling united had to do as they zig-zagged around america , playing games in pasadena , denver , washington , detroit and miami .
next summer’s tour , meanwhile , will almost certainly be to asia , a continent united haven’t visited since david moyes’ pre-season of 2013 .
