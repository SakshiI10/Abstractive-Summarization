Summary:
federico fazio , alongside eric dier in central defence , was handed the unenviable task of taming christian benteke after jan vertonghen missed out through illness .
pochettino made a double switch 11 minutes from time : erik lamela replaced andros townsend and deandre yedlin came on for his spurs debut in place of chiriches , who departed to ironic applause .
