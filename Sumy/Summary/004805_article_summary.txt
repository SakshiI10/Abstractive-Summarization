Summary:
most women are well aware that wearing high heels for any length of time can result in sore feet , pinched toes and tight calf muscles .
i had to have a bunion surgically removed from my left foot last year , too , which was caused - or certainly worsened - by years of wearing tight , pointy stilettos . '
