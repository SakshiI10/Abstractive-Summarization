Summary:
sam 's plan may not work however , as it would have taken a second amazing feat for him to actually win the prize , with the top 1percent of entries being entered for a random drawing , which in this case would put his odds at roughly 1 in 115,000 .
' sam should now be eligible for the $ 30,000 grand prize of a $ 20,000 best buy gift card and an all-inclusive trip to hawaii this november , but is too young .
