Summary:
i had to hold this tension for 30 seconds while staring at the ceiling .
facial exercising is not for the lazy - it takes about 20 minutes a day and it really does hurt in places - but after two weeks my husband is convinced he can see a difference , and i feel a bit more plumped up ; more ruddy farmer 's wife than aging , old crone .
