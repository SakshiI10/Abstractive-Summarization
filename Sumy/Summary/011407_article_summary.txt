Summary:
instead stf hardens upon impact at any temperature , providing protection from penetration by high-speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area . '
we needed to find , design a liquid that functions both with projectiles hitting at the velocity of 450 meters per second and higher . '
