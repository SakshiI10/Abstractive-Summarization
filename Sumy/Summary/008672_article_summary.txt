Summary:
barring an unforeseen blip , chelsea will win the title and that is why , if i was still playing , my vote would have gone to hazard .
chelsea couldnâ€™t contain paris saint-germain over two matches , conceding at both the parc des princes and stamford bridge , while manchester city were easily breached twice by barcelona when tumbling out .
