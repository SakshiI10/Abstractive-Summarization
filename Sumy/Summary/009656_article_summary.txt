Summary:
if comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko is representative of all cometary nuclei , then we suggest that magnetic forces are unlikely to have played a role in the accumulation of planetary building blocks greater than one meter ( 3 feet ) in size . '
auster did not find any magnetic field , with a very sensitive instrument , so it seems unlikely that magnetism in the solar nebula was significant for the collection of meter-sized objects , ' treiman said in an email . '
