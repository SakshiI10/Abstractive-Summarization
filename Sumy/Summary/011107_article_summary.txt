Summary:
dog walkers have been warned about deliberate attempts to kill their animals after cocktail sausages laced with poison were found at a popular walking spot .
thankfully i have a search dog that is able to indicate if something does n't smell right , but please watch any dog off the lead as they were not in eye sight but easily consumed and in multiple places along the trail . '
