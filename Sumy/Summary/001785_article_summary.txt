Summary:
around 1.3 billion chinese people marked the qingming festival , a three-day holiday in china , by watching parades and travelling home .
while millions of chinese people made the trip to their ancestral villages , opportunistic traders took advantage of some people 's inability to make the visit - advertising ' tomb sweeping packages ' which include weeping , praying and cleaning .
