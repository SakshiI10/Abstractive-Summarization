Summary:
parker closes down holland forward marco van basten during one of his 19 caps for england .
the ebay seller described parker , 50 , as an 'ex-manchester united and chelsea legend ' but , while he made more than 100 appearances for united and won two league titles , his grand total of four outings for the blues does n't quite merit legendary status .
