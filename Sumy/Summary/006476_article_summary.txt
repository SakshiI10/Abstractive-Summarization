Summary:
whichever way you look at it , scottish football , like an unsafe , stinking high rise on the wrong side of glasgow , needs wiping out and starting again .
it 's not all bad - falkirk 's matchwinner on saturday craig sibbald looks like a decent footballer , yet he ca n't get in the scotland under 21 squad .
