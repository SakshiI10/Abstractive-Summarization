Summary:
i traveled to little rock with three phenomenal `` fitspirations '' : samantha goga , natali villarruel and umber rahman -- who are members of an obstacle course race group called the midwest vikings .
with two falls behind me ( hey , those clips take some getting used to ) , we got in nearly 23 miles and a new addiction was born .
