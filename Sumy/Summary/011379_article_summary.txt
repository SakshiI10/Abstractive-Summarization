Summary:
wenger has not come out on top against mourinho in 12 attempts and a win this weekend would be particularly welcome for the frenchman as arsenal look to cement second place .
john terry has been brilliant this year but he does sit off a bit deeper now to allow for his lack of pace and that might give more space in midfield . '
