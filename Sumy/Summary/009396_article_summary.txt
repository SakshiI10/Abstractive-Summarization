Summary:
he seems to be on top of the big two senior bowlers in anderson and stuart broad , as was made clear in the first test when he had a little argument over fielding positions with anderson and very much got his own way .
ok , cook hasnâ€™t scored that elusive century yet and the big test will come when he faces the moving ball again but for now his game looks in very good order again and he is making very good half-centuries .
