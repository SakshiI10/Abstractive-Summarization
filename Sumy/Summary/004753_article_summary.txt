Summary:
the ' ghetto burger ' is a double cheeseburger with bacon , grilled onions , ketchup , mustard and chili .
only eight people could be seated at the counter at a time , meaning the wait for a spot could run as long as two hours , but people were still willing to hang around if it meant getting to that famous patty .
