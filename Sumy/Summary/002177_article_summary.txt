Summary:
saracens pressurised clermont with the same fierce defence that knocked them so spectacularly off their stride in last year’s semi-final at twickenham .
but , after winning at racing metro in the quarter final while watching premiership rivals northampton capitulate to clermont two weeks ago , mccall’s men still have every chance of delivering a trophy this season .
