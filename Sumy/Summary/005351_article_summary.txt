Summary:
carrying bags of warhol prints and a sunday morning sized moma mug , we hopped into one of new york’s iconic yellow taxis for a short ride to low-rise williamsburg , where another hipster favourite – craft beer – is taking hold .
it was all delicious and a pleasant change from the budweiser usually found in american bars .
