lorenzo insigne reacts as napoli lost 1-0 at home to lazio on wednesday and exited the coppa italia .
the defeat also increased pressure on coach rafael benitez , who led napoli to a third-placed finish and the coppa italia title last season but has failed to build on what was considered a reasonable , but unspectacular , first season .
