Summary:
if that price does not deter manchester city , chelsea , arsenal or real madrid then pedro , who has been looked at before by brendan rodgers , would become a realistic target for liverpool .
joining his former manager pep guardiola at bayern would leave pedro with the same difficulty when it came to getting into the first team that he encounters at barcelona , while inter would not be able to match liverpool in terms of wages .
