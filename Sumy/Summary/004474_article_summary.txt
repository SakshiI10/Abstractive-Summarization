Summary:
barnet , who lead the conference by one point , have a home game against mid-table gateshead on saturday while rovers face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom alfreton , who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated .
there was the odd dead cat bounce , but six months on they are still bottom after failing to keep a clean sheet for nineteen consecutive matches .
