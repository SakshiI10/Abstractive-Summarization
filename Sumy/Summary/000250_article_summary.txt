Summary:
there 's so much wrong with boxing 's business model , but all you really need to understand is this : most sports fans probably ca n't name a single active boxer after mayweather and pacquiao .
there 's a great literature on boxing , with contributions from writers such as ernest hemingway , norman mailer and joyce carol oates .
