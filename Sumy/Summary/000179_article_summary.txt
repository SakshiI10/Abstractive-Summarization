Summary:
let me add this , as someone who has followed him closely ( and with admiration ) for a long time : when people stop to listen to bernie , they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is , without a question , an authentic voice who speaks without fear .
he has been one of only a few voices in the senate in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right-wing factions funded by `` millionaires and billionaires '' ( one of bernie 's favorite mantras ) have held sway over american politics for as long as anyone can recall .
