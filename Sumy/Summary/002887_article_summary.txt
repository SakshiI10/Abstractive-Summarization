Summary:
we have a rule in medicine that any single mouth ulcer lasting longer than three weeks should be investigated in order to rule out a cancer of the mouth , but this would usually be an isolated ulcer that does not heal , rather than multiple lesions .
it is treatable with antibiotics , but diagnosis can be difficult as many do n't realise they have been bitten .
