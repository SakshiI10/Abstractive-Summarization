Summary:
mauricio pochettino , who demands a high-energy pressing game from his teams , must have been delighted that they collectively just outran southampton to earn their 2-2 draw at st mary’s .
that’s a huge contrast to last year under first andre villas-boas and then tim sherwood , when they finished bottom of the same table .
