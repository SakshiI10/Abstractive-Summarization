Summary:
incoming ecb chairman colin graves has offered just enough encouragement for him to believe he could once again wear the three lions - despite a year of bitter recriminations and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography .
captain alastair cook , who was not given a glittering write-up in pietersen 's book , largely absolved himself from the decision-making process , insisting it would be taken by graves , managing director of england cricket paul downton and chief executive tom harrison .
