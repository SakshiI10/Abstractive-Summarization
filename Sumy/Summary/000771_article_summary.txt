Summary:
a more serious critique of the clinton foundations is that they have been an administrative and financial quagmire from their origins , running deficits , expanding uncontrollably and cutting deals that not only raise ethical questions but cast the family 's management skill in a less-than-flattering light .
in a well-known case of deception , a con man named raffaello follieri charmed his way into the foundation 's good graces , earning public praise from bill clinton for promising $ 50 million to the clinton global initiative -- money that never materialized .
