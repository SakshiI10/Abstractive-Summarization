Summary:
her friend martin lawrence , 27 , also targeted a man aged 99 claiming he owed him money for non existing paving work .
i hope that today 's sentencing acts as a warning to others who may think they can get away with targeting more vulnerable members in our society - this sort of heinous crime is one that we take extremely seriously and we will do everything in our power to trace those responsible and put them behind bars for their actions .
