Summary:
the u.s. supreme court 's arguments on tuesday over same-sex marriage will cap more than two decades of litigation and a transformation in public attitudes .
that 5-4 decision did not address a constitutional right to same-sex marriage , but lower court judges interpreted the ruling as an endorsement of it and began invalidating state bans .
