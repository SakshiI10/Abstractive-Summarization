Summary:
there can certainly be no doubt chelsea are in a far stronger position than when abramovich bought the club from ken bates for £140m on june 1 , 2003 .
mourinho did not name them , but dominic solanke , patrick bamford , lewis baker and isaiah brown are thought to be highly-rated at chelsea , who supply many of the players in england’s age-group teams .
