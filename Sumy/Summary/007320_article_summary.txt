Summary:
european wine laws protect what can be labelled as prosecco under doc — meaning denominazione di origine controllata — regulations ( similar to the ones that decree champagne must come from a certain region of france ) .
this one wins points for its stylish label — shallow , i know , but more importantly what’s inside is light , fresh and extremely drinkable .
