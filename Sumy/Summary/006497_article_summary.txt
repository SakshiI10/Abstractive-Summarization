Summary:
graziano pelle should have doubled the lead when played in by a lively sadio mane but stoke goalkeeper asmir begovic saved well to leave koeman ruing his side’s profligacy .
’ adam’s fellow substitute peter crouch could have piled on the agony for koeman after being teed up by jonathan walters but scuffed his shot wide from six yards .
