Summary:
i also use mint tea for indigestion and make a remedy from the lemon balm that grows in my garden to help me sleep .
for example , if i have a menopausal woman coming to see me with hot flushes and she ca n't take hrt because she has had breast cancer , or has been using hrt for the recommended two to four years and must come off it , there are a few homeopathic remedies i can suggest - belladonna being the most common .
