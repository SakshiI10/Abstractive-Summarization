Summary:
in his apr√®s-paxman mode , david cameron ( pictured ) was looking serious and oozing leadership charisma .
he took enough pops at cameron and waved his arm enough in that direction to signal an official end to the relationship that began in the rose garden but he looked more congruent agreeing with cameron or fielding criticism as a double act than he did turning on him , which looked rather panto .
