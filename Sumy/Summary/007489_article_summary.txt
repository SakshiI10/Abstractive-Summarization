Summary:
bara want limited departures from the first team this summer because they can’t sign players until january but they also want to blood young players from their b-team out on loan at higher leagues because their second string is likely to be playing third division football .
iker casillas doesn’t want to leave but if real madrid sign david de gea he may be more tempted .
