Summary:
2001 : i really don’t trust a woman who says she doesn’t have time to go to the hair salon , apply make-up , or steam the creases from her trousers ... now : gone is the fright wig , and in its place is a chic , choppy , youthful but not frivolous , golden halo of princess diana-like loveliness – a ray of sunshine that says this woman means business .
now : i can hardly believe this is the same woman : she appears confident , fit , and full of dynamic energy .
