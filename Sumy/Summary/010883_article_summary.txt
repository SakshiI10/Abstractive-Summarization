Summary:
even those players from that team who never went on to manage have stayed in football with giovanni now working as a scout for olympiakos and guillermo amor a former director of barcelona’s youth academy who is now director of football at adelaide united fc .
it’s perhaps more of a surprise that so many attacking players also graduated to the technical area .
