Summary:
at first glance the rectangular island of por-bajin looks like a foreboding fortress or prison , with its regular structure and ruined sections .
although it is said to be around 1,300 years old , many walls were intact and well preserved with a main structure in the inner courtyard being separated into two parts , covered by a tiled roof walkway supported by 36 wooden columns on stone bases .
