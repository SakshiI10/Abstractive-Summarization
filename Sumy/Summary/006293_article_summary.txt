Summary:
as she and her husband waited for an ambulance , injured from the collision moments before , what they needed was help and assistance but instead this thief took advantage of the opportunity , preyed upon their vulnerable state and stole their sat nav .
it is a sickening , appalling and cruel act and while i doubt the thief is ashamed of himself , i 'm sure anyone reading or hearing this appeal will be disgusted . '
