Summary:
the report , prepared by an old age think tank , the international longevity centre-uk , and backed by insurance firm onefamily , suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths .
younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families , and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents , many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system .
