Summary:
although massimon cellini , leedsâ€™ banned owner , has subsequently claimed thomson had used abusive language towards sporting director nicola salerno , it was only another spanner in the works for this once-proud club who need stability more than anything .
still , it was leeds who struck the first blow , courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from kevin mcdonald who , penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant kalvin phillips , attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off richard stearman , his own team-mate , for charlie taylor to sidefoot under carl ikeme .
