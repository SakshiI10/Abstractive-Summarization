Summary:
chua sat impassively in the dock as jurors were told how over more than a dozen pages of sometimes hard-to-follow broken english written in scrawling capital letters , he recounts the story of his life , beginning : ‘ my name is victorino domingo chua .
chua described himself at that time as ‘ a naughty boy , doing bad things’ , taking medical gear from the manila hospital where he worked and selling them to people who couldn’t afford treatment .
