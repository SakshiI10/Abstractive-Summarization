Summary:
it is a hill start to give even the most confident learner driver nightmares .
made of one single bamboo log for your feet , and another as a rather unsteady handrail , this bridge us named from the stooped 'monkey-like ' posture people must adapt when crossing to try and avoid falling into the river below .
