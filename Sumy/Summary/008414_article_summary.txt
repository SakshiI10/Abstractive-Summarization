Summary:
trott’s only rival for the opener slot , yorkshire’s adam lyth , was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off-stump for 23 but alastair cook and ian bell looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match .
those decisions aside the second in a pair of two-day fixtures has been little more than a glorified training drill , with plunkett , mark wood and jonny bairstow dropped in to strengthen the flimsy local side , while gary ballance , trott and root featured for both teams at various points .
