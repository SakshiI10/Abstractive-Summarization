Summary:
timing matters because society changes , and now that our horizons have been broadened we can not just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago , before we realized its negative potential .
because indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate , and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief .
