Summary:
much of the build-up to that fractious encounter centred on the fact it was a reunion between murray and his close friend and assistant coach dani vallverdu , who had switched jobs to work with world no 9 berdych .
murray reached the last four in key biscayne after a three-set defeat of rising prospect dominic thiem .
