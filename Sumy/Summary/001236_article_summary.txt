Summary:
daniel smith got skipper danny kirmond through a chink in the visitors ' defence for one try and stand-off pita godinet added another on the stroke of half-time , darting over from dummy half , as wakefield eyed a repeat of last year 's shock win over wane 's men .
however , the game always looked to be within wigan 's grasp and they opened up a three-score lead on 57 minutes when prop lee mossop proved unstoppable from 10 metres out .
