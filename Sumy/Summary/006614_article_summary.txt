Summary:
holder’s unbeaten 103 , sealed with two majestic straight boundaries off james tredwell , could have ended on 66 when billy bowden gave him out caught down the legside even though anderson barely appealed .
cook’s declaration came at the right time , giving his side 130 overs to bowl west indies out and leaving them with very little chance of victory .
