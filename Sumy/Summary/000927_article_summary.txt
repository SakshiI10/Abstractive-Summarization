Summary:
london ( cnn ) the pentagon released a map this week showing coalition forces have taken back 25-30 % of iraqi territory seized by isis .
the one difference between isis and insurgencies in general is that isis declared itself a state , a caliphate once had territory so any loss is very strategic loss of prestige and image for them .
