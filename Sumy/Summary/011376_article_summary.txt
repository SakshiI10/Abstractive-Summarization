Summary:
neville wrote in his telegraph column that should a player such as paul pogba or mats hummels decide on a move to england , they are unlikely to select the etihad as their destination - now that manuel pellegrini 's side have been reined in by financial fair play .
unless city are bold and decide to take on uefa’s financial fair play regulations , they will find it difficult to compete with united , chelsea and arsenal for the players i believe could make the difference in next season’s title race , ' said neville . '
