Summary:
scott dann was a fraction offside when he set up glenn murray for palace’s first goal ( 2 ) , but it would be harsh to put too much blame on assistant john brooks .
he was spot on with two equally tight calls in the same move — before dann got the ball ( 1 ) and for murray’s finish ( 3 ) .
