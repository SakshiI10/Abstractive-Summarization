Summary:
with los blancos in disarray , a couple of weeks spent healing wounds away from the santiago bernabeu seemed an agreeable plan , while barcelona 's momentum was disrupted .
suarez , meanwhile , went down in the box looking for a penalty under an arm from gustavo cabral , but far too little contact to actually tumble .
