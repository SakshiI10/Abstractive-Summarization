Summary:
two reputable online surveys found no link between the use of pornography and erection problems , despite popular perception that watching too much porn leads to ed ( erectile dysfunction ) .
what does make sense ( though , again not proven ) is that men who have difficulties turn to porn as a way of experiencing sex without embarrassment .
