Summary:
with a 10-point advantage , even if jose mourinho loses to arsene wenger for the first time on sunday it won’t stop his side becoming champions .
laurent koscielny has steadied things in defence , with arsenal winning 15 of the 18 games he’s played since january 1 but , to progress , wenger needs another top centre back .
