Summary:
robert lewandowski returned to haunt his former club as bayern munich earned a narrow victory against borussia dortmund at the signal iduna park on saturday .
former manchester united midfielder kagawa or mkhitaryan will surely feature in the second half if dortmund 's current attacking players fail to cancel out lewandowski 's opener .
