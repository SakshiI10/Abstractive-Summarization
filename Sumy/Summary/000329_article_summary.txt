Summary:
the spirit of lincoln 's second inaugural was self-evident on april 9 , 1865 -- 150 years ago -- when confederate gen. robert e. lee dramatically surrendered his approximately 28,000 troops to union general ulysses s. grant at appomattox courthouse ( mclean house ) in virginia .
after being present at lee 's dramatic surrender at appomattox , walker , a battle-fatigued confederate , laid down his rifle and journeyed back to red-clay , georgia , traveling mainly on foot , passing ragged clusters of rebel amputees , many hobbling on bayonet crutches , others with arms or heads swathed in bandages and all heading in the same direction : home .
