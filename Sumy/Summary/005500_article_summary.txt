Summary:
brave finley lamb suffers from rare brain abnormality periventricular nodular heterotopia - which means many of his ' grey matter ' cells have not migrated to the correct position .
i think sometimes there is a misconception that disabled children do n't realise what they are missing , but it was shocking for us to find out just how much finley actually does understand .
