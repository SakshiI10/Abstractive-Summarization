Summary:
carrick made his england debut against mexico in may 2001 as a teenager with west ham united and if – as now seems likely – he carries through to euro 2016 , he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary sir stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years .
the only player to have had a longer career since matthews is goalkeeper peter shilton who played for england between 1971 and 1990 .
