Summary:
with old firm bosses ronny deila and stuart mccall looking on , it was the former who left happiest after seeing tommy mcintyre’s side record a deserved victory .
they almost paid for their slackness in front of goal , with gers’ sam jamieson forcing a terrific tip over the bar from keeper ross doohan .
