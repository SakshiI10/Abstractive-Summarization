Summary:
getting the tune underway , sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on sky’s ear as if whispering something – sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction .
the howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up .
