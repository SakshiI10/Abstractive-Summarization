Summary:
siem de jong is on track to play a part in newcastle 's barclays premier league clash with swansea after taking another step towards ending his eight-month injury nightmare .
victory - something they have not tasted since february 28 - over the swans on saturday would go a long way towards erasing any fears of being sucked into trouble , although with many fans in open rebellion over owner mike ashley 's stewardship , it may do little to ease the tension on tyneside .
