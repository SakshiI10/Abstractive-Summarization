but having stumbled to a 3-0 defeat against queens and a 1-1 draw with basement side livingston either side of sunday 's four-goal romp over raith , there is no guarantee the light blues will see off saturday 's trip to dumbarton without another slip-up .
mccall confirmed the club 's five loanees from newcastle are registered until june 9 , and will be free to play whatever happens .
