Summary:
the niva ( pictured ) is a highly capable , ruftytufty 4x4 from russia — for a fraction of the price of a new land rover and it is also available in a compact van format ( £10,590 , excluding vat and road tax ) .
patriotic russian president vladimir putin ( pictured ) drove a lada niva back in 2009 — but fitted it with a german engine .
