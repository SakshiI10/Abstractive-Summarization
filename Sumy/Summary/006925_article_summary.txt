Summary:
the jellyfish , which can grow up to six feet and weigh 55lb , were sighted just off pendennis point near falmouth , cornwall .
matt slater of the cornwall wildlife trust said it was ‘ difficult to say what is causing their appearance , but it could be because there is more plankton for the jellyfish to feed on because of warmer waters’ .
